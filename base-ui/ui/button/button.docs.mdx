description: 'A Button component for buttons and elements that look like buttons'
labels: ['button', 'primary', 'secondary']
---

import { Button } from './button';
import { FigmaEmbed } from '@learn-bit-react/base-ui.figma.figma-embed';

Button renders the HTML tag `<button>` as default but can use any HTML tag instead such as an `<a>` tag.

### Renders a primary button

By adding the `primary` prop, the button will be styled as primary button. This can be changed to `secondary` or `white`.

```js live
<Button primary>Primary</Button>
```

### Renders a disabled button

Add the disabled attribute to the button to disable it.

```js live
<Button disabled>disabled</Button>
```

### Renders a Link Component that looks like a Button

`link` prop allows you to render the `<Link>` component instead of the `<button>` tag for rendering internal links that look like buttons. Button attributes are removed and any attributes of the `<Link>` Component can be used such as `href`.

```js live
<Button primary link href="/">
  Link
</Button>
```

### Renders a counter button

By adding the `counter` prop, the button will be styled as counter button

```js live
<Button counter>+</Button>
```

### Renders a TailwindCSS button

Tailwind has been applied to the env component that this component depends on and therfore TailwindCSS classes can be used.

```js live
<Button className="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded p-20">
  Tailwind Button
</Button>
```
