description: 'A Button component for buttons and elements that look like buttons'
labels: ['button', 'primary', 'secondary']

import { Button } from './button';
import { FigmaEmbed } from '@learn-bit-react/base-ui.figma.figma-embed';

Button renders the HTML tag `<button>` as default but can use any HTML tag instead such as an `<a>` tag.

### Renders a primary button

By adding the `primary` prop, the button will be styled as secondary button. This can be changed to `secondary` or removed to make it a `white` button.

```js live
<Button primary>Primary</Button>
```

### Renders a disabled button

Add the disabled attribute to the button to disable it.

```js live
<Button disabled>disabled</Button>
```

### Renders a Link that looks like a Button

`as` prop allows you to add any HTML tag such as an `a` tag. Button attributes are removed and any attributes of the element specified can be used such as `href` for `a` elements.

```js live
<Button primary as="a" href="/">
  Link
</Button>
```
