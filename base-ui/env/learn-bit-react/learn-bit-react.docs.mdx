## Overview

A customized version which extends the default React component development environment created by teambit. This environment can be applied to all your components or a set of components under the variants of your `workspace.json` file. That means they will use your custom environment instead of the default environment. Environment components are just like any other Bit components in that they can be exported and then shared and used in various projects which makes it easier to create standards when working with many teams.

### Usage instructions

When creating an environment component make sure to apply the aspect environment under the **variant** section of your `workspace.json`. In the example below the all components under the `env` namepsace will have the aspect environment applied.

```json
{
  "teambit.workspace/variants": {
    "{env/*}": {
      "teambit.harmony/aspect": {}
    }
  }
}
```

Under the **variant** section of your `workspace.json` file choose which components you want to have the custom environment set. You can find the id of the extension in the [`learn-bit-react.aspect.ts`](https://bit.dev/learn-bit-react/base-ui/env/learn-bit-react/~code/learn-bit-react.aspect.ts) file.

```json
{
  "teambit.workspace/variants": {
    "{env/*}": {
      "teambit.harmony/aspect": {}
    },
    "{templates/ui/**}, {templates/pages/**}": {
      "learn-bit-react.base-ui/env/learn-bit-react": {}
    }
  }
}
```

## Runtime Configurations

Extend the `main.runtime` file when you want to add custom configurations at runtime.

### Compilation

By default, Component compilation is done with the TypeScript compiler. Target format is `ES2015` which
supports execution from both NodeJS and browser runtimes for server-side rendering. You can modify the [`tsconfig.json`](https://bit.dev/learn-bit-react/base-ui/env/learn-bit-react/~code/typescript/tsconfig.json) file to add your own compiler options which will then be merged with the default configs set by teambit.

Example:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es2017",
    "module": "es2015",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "lib": ["es2017", "dom"],
    "experimentalDecorators": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "outDir": "dist",
    "sourceMap": true,
    "emitDecoratorMetadata": true,
    "allowJs": true,
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "jsx": "react"
  }
}
```

### Testing

Component testing is done through [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) with the default `teambit.react/react` environment. You can modify the `jestconfig.js` file to add your own configurations which will then be merged with the default configs set by teambit.

Example:

To Override the Jest config to ignore transpiling from specific folders add this to the [`jest.config.js`](https://bit.dev/learn-bit-react/base-ui/env/learn-bit-react/~code/jest/jest.config.js) file:

```js
const reactJestConfig = require('@teambit/react/jest/jest.config');
const {
  generateNodeModulesPattern
} = require('@teambit/dependencies.modules.packages-excluder');

const packagesToExclude = ['packages-to-exclude-here'];

module.exports = {
  ...reactJestConfig,
  transformIgnorePatterns: [
    '^.+\\.module\\.(css|sass|scss)$',
    generateNodeModulesPattern({ packages: packagesToExclude })
  ]
};
```

### Webpack

Bit uses webpack 5 to bundle components. You can modify the [`webpack.config.js`](https://bit.dev/learn-bit-react/base-ui/env/learn-bit-react/~code/webpack/webpack.config.js) file to add your own configurations which will then be merged with the default configs set by teambit.

Example:

```ts
module.exports = {
  module: {
    // add your custom rules here
    rules: []
  }
};
```

### ESLint

Bit uses ESLint to lint your components. You can add your own rules in the [`learn-bit-react.main.runtime`](https://bit.dev/learn-bit-react/base-ui/env/learn-bit-react/~code/learn-bit-react.main.runtime.ts) file.

Example:

```ts
react.useEslint({
  transformers: [
    (config) => {
      config.setRule('no-console', ['error']);
      // add more rules here
      return config;
    }
  ]
}),
```

To use ESLint:

```bash
bit lint
bit lint --fix
```

### Formatting

Bit uses Prettier to format your components. You can add your own rules in the [`learn-bit-react.main.runtime`](https://bit.dev/learn-bit-react/base-ui/env/learn-bit-react/~code/learn-bit-react.main.runtime.ts) file.

Example:

```ts
react.usePrettier({
  ransformers: [
    (config) => {
      config.setKey('tabWidth', 2);
      // add more rules here
      return config;
    }
  ]
}),
```

To use Prettier:

```bash
bit format --check
bit format
```

### Dependencies

Override the default dependencies in the [`learn-bit-react.main.runtime`](https://bit.dev/learn-bit-react/base-ui/env/learn-bit-react/~code/learn-bit-react.main.runtime.ts) file to include react types of a different version for example.

```ts
react.overrideDependencies({
  devDependencies: {
    '@types/react': '17.0.3'
  }
});
```

## Preview Configurations

Extend the [`learn-bit-react.preview.runtime`](https://bit.dev/learn-bit-react/base-ui/env/learn-bit-react/~code/learn-bit-react.preview.runtime.ts) file when you want to add your own customizations only for previewing in the Bit UI.

### Adding a Theme

A custom theme has been added to the env which wraps all the composition files with the required theme so they can be developed with the correct themeing rather than the browsers default. This is added only in the preview runtime and not in the main runtime meaning it is only applied to compositons and not when consuimg components. Adding a theme when consuming should be done at App level as you component may be consumed in varios apps and have different themes applied depending on where it is consumed.

Example:

```ts
react.registerProvider([ThemeCompositions, Theme]);
```

### Adding TailwindCSS

In order for Tailwind to work within your Bit compositions you will need to add TaiwlindCSS to the env. First createa a folder and add a [`styles.css`](https://bit.dev/learn-bit-react/base-ui/env/learn-bit-react/~code/tailwind/styles.css) file which contains all the Tailwind styles you need.

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

Add your [`tailwind.config.js`](https://bit.dev/learn-bit-react/base-ui/env/learn-bit-react/~code/tailwind/tailwind.config.js) file in the tailwind folder.

```jsx
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {}
  },
  variants: {
    extend: {}
  },
  plugins: []
};
```

Install the [TaiwlwindCSS webpack transformer component](https://bit.dev/bit-foundations/styling/tailwind/webpack-transformer) created by teambit.

```bash
bit install @bit-foundations/styling.tailwind.webpack-transformer
```

Add the following to the [`main.runtime.ts`](https://bit.dev/learn-bit-react/base-ui/env/learn-bit-react/~code/learn-bit-react.main.runtime.ts) file

```jsx
import { UseTailwindTransformer } from '@bit-foundations/styling.tailwind.webpack-transformer';
```

Inside the provider add the following code

```jsx
static async provider([react, envs]: [ReactMain, EnvsMain]) {
const {
      previewConfigTransformer: twPreviewTransformer,
      devServerConfigTransformer: twDevServerTransformer
    } = UseTailwindTransformer(tailwindConfigPath);
...
}
```

Inside your `envs.compose` where you override files for TypScript, webpack, Jest etc add in the following code to webpack so you can use the TailwindPreview and DevServer Transformers

```jsx
const MyEnvEnv = envs.compose(react.reactEnv, [

      react.useWebpack({
        previewConfig: [twPreviewTransformer],
        devServerConfig: [twDevServerTransformer]
      }),
```

In the [`preview.runtime.ts`](https://bit.dev/learn-bit-react/base-ui/env/learn-bit-react/~code/learn-bit-react.preview.runtime.ts) file import the css file.

```jsx
import './tailwind/styles.css';
```

Note: only TailwindCSS 2 is supported in Bit as TailwindCSS 3 uses the JIT compiler which Bit does not have support for yet.
