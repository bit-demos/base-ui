## Overview

A standard React development environment for building modular and reusable MFEs.

### Usage instructions

Create a **variant** in project's `workspace.json` file.  
Set this extension as the variant's extension.

```json
{
  "teambit.workspace/variants": {
    "{ui/*}": {
      "learn-bit-react.base-ui/env/learn-bit-react": {}
    }
  }
}
```

### Routing

By default, all compositions render under the React Router `MemoryRouter` context. This allows the development of
components which depend on React Router.

### Compilation

By default, Component compilation is done with the TypeScript compiler. Target format is `ES2015` which
supports execution from both NodeJS and browser runtimes for server-side rendering.

### Testing

Component testing is done through [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) with the default `teambit.react/react`.

### Extend

This component development environment can be easily extended. Just add the env as a dependency of your extension
and use the extension API.
